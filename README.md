# Geospatial Analysis

Just before applied to geographic models, geospatial analysis is the collection, visualization, and manipulation of imagery, GPS, satellite photography, and historical data that is either explicitly described in terms of geographic coordinates or implicitly in terms of a street address, postal code, or forest stand identifier.

The earliest geographic information systems were developed in Canada in the 1960s for documenting natural resources (GIS). All kinds of occurrences affecting the globe, its systems, and its inhabitants can be predicted, managed, and learned about using geographic information systems.

Crisis management, climate change modeling, weather monitoring, sales analysis, human population forecasts, and animal population management are just a few of the many uses for geospatial analysis. Geospatial analysts separate pertinent information from unrelated information and use it to construct and represent the hierarchy.
